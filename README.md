Hestia is a web app where developers can quickly create and host multi-user and real-time web apps. Users can interact with a web app together in groups called "_rooms_". In each room, an instance of a web app is created, which can be anything such as multiplayer games, chat systems, and drawing tools.

Want to make your own app? Check out the list of apps at [Hestia Apps](https://github.com/LenKagamine/hestia-apps)!
